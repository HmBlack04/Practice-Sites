    <h1>HANGMAN</h1>

    <p>
        Here we have a classic game of Hangman, guess the word and you win, don't guess and your opponent wins.
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunatly, there is no word to guess here, so the ending is innevitable :(</p>
<br>
    <p>Use the Set Up button to make the gallows and the add a guess button to add a body part.</p>    

    <button onclick="drawGame()">Set Up</button>
    <button id="add">Add a guess!</button>
